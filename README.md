Kenematic arrive: when a 3d game model move to destination their movement close to the destination isn't smooth and most often time circles the end point becaue their last 'move' would be further than the end point. Kenematic arrive adjust the object/character movement and allow them to arrive without the movement bug. 
Formational movement: move multiple objects in a formation at fix distance and location from each other (x, y, and z). The leader arrive at the end point, the other member arrive in formation with respect to the leader.
